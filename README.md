## Personal Portfolio Site

examples of site design I like

https://www.gourmetmarketing.net/ (the rotating card)

http://tondo.design/#kvadrat (the full page theme design)

http://youxventures.com/ (landing page video with design overlay, card for projects)

http://careers.remindermedia.com/ (font on landing is nice, scroll icon for call to action)

http://www.overtongraphics.com/ (thin sidebar that spans outward, panels for project showcase that changes scroll )

user flow


landing page

 is full screen (no header or footer in view) abstract shapes cut the design in two. On one side is video of hands typing on keyboard. The other is a large colored card that cycles through colors and saying things like [Full-Stack,Front-End, Back-End, App, Game ] (maybe with different fonts) With the word Developer next to it. Small scroll icon at bottom of page. As user scrolls it brings in the nave bar to the left with quick links and displays About Me section. 

side bar has links to Home- About Me- Past Work - Contact Me / Resume

past work 

section has long thin cards with img, desc, and links (scrolls to the right to showcase more cards) Top bar has all the same color and names as the main page to swap between examples of those type of works.

Contact me / Resume 

simple contact form with validation. Maybe something animated on the page to show progress. Link to download PDF resume.
